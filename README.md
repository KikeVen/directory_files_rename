Lists all files in a specified directory (source_directory). Separates the file extention
    from the file name (file_extention). If the file extentions are not includes in the exclusion 
    list, then renames the files with the original file extention into another specified 
    directory (destination_directory) with a new name based on enumerator (my_enumerator), 
    formated date (day_formated), time (time_formated) and original file extention (file_extention)
