If the file extensions are not includes in the exclusion list, then renames the files with the original file extension into another specified directory `[destination_directory]` . The new file name is based on enumerator `[my_enumerator]` , formated date `[day_formated]` , time `[time_formated]` and original file extension `[file_extension]`
