# Script for renaming files in a directory

Lists all files in a specified directory `[source_directory]` . Separates the file extention from the file name`[file_extention]` . If the file extentions are not includes in the exclusion list, then renames the files with the original file extention into another specified directory ***(destination_directory)*** . The new file name is based on enumerator ***(my_enumerator)*** , formated date ***(day_formated)*** , time ***(time_formated)*** and original file extention ***(file_extention)***
